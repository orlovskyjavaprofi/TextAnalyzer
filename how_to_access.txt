Each endpoint of this server can be reached as following
==========================================================

First you need to run the server from the .Net Application directory called textanalyzer: dotnet run

Once started it will give you access, then you use it via webbrowser or postman.

Copy the ipadress:port combination from the console where you started the servern and then use it in webbrowser or postman like following:
ipadress:port/api/NameOfController/nameOfEndPoint?message=YourInput

Name of controller: is the name of controller where all endpoints are defined
Name of endpoint: is the name of the endpoint which you want to use
YourInput: is what you want to send to server

Example: http://localhost:5183/api/ControllerStringVerifier/count-words?message=Welcome to a simple webservice
you will see the result in your browser or postman, which in  this case would be a json response 5.
